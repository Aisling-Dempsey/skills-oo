What are the three main design advantages that object orientation can provide?

Explain each concept.

    Encapsulation: Makes your program have completely self-contained chunks allowing them to work independently of
    one another

What is a class?
    a class is a template that can be instantiated to create a unique instance of it each time it is called.

What is an instance attribute?
    an instance is an attribute that is defined at the instance level. For example, if Cat is a class, and
    Ezra and Auden are instances of the cat class, an instance attribute is an attribute that Ezra or Auden has
    but the other may not necessarily have.

What is a method?
    a method is a function defined within a class that acts on an instance of the class when the method is called.

What is an instance in object orientation?
    an instance is a unique object that inherits attributes and methods from the class used to instantiate it.

How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute? Give an example of when you might use each.
    a class attibute is something that is common for all instances of a class.
